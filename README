Edit ip2c.tcl change variable mirror to your preference 
then type tclsh install.tcl

The auto install should work, however I've noticed, that sometimes it doesn't, but I can't seem to 
figur out why that is.

manual install

open tclsh shell type

set tcl_pkgPath
mkdir ip2c in that path then copy ip2c.tcl and pkgIndex.tcl to that directory, .. 
and that's it.
